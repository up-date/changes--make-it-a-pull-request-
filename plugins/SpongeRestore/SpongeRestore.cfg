# SpongeRestore Configuration
#

# Excluded Worlds [names separated by commas]
#	Here you list all the worlds in which you
#	do not want this plugin to work in.
excludedWorlds=

# Sponge Saturation [true or false]
#	Add more realism to sponges by making them only
#	absorb water from an area without blocking
#	water's flow afterwards.
spongeSaturation=false

# Water Replacement
#	Can a player place water near a sponge
#	while it is still there?
canPlaceWater=false

# Craftable Sponges
#	Choose whether this plugin lets players craft
#	sponges or not. Useful for if you use another
#	plugin to handle crafting recipes.
craftableSponges=true

# Lava
#	Should lava be affected also? Lava will be treated
#	exactly like water as chosen in the other settings.
absorbLava=false

# Debug Messages
#	This tends to spam your console, so you'd be best
#	served leaving this off unless you know what
#	you're doing.
debug=false

# Fire
#	Should fire be affected too??? It'll get treated
#	just like the liquids.
absorbFire=false

# Fire Extinguisher
#	This option only works when absorbFire is true.
#	With this enabled, sponges will go out of their way
#	to put out fires that try to burn any blocks within
#	their effective area, adequately preventing the
#	eternal burning bush effect.
attackFire=false

# Affected Radius
#	Here you can choose how large the area the sponge affects
#	will be. It is based on the numbers of blocks away from
#	the sponge. For example, setting this to 2 will give you a
#	5x5x5 block area. It's recommended that you do not set
#	this value to high as the plugin must check every block
#	in the set radius.
spongeRadius=2

# Water Restoration
#	After sponges are removed, they can leave ugly cascades
#	of water. With this option turned on, sponges will
#	expel their water when they are removed, thus allowing
#	the water to be restored.
restoreWater=false

# Water Flowtime Multiplier
#	This relates to the Water Restoration feature.
#	It multiplies by the spongeRadius in order to calculate
#	the amount of time water should be given to flow back.
#	Radius * Multiplier = FlowTime (in Milliseconds)
#	Ex: 2 x 600 = 1200 milliseconds for water to restore itself.
#	You only need to change it if your server is really slow.
flowTimeMult=600

# Piston Effect
#	Can pistons move sponges?
pistonMove=true
